# StatCheck

Working Application unless otherwise stated. (Current Date: Aug 7, 2023)

As a personal project, I have always used websites such as Statmuse or Basketball Reference to look at more in depth statistics than the ones google can provide, however I often find myself looking at these statistics on my iPhone. This prompted me to look for a mobile version of either website, to which I found no replacement. The existing mobile version of Statmuse is nowhere near the accesibility of their web version thus I built this project. 

How To Use The Application?

Currently as I did not want to pay for an Apple Developper Program account, it can be simulated on your local device (provided it uses MacOS and has XCode installed) or on a simulator that XCode provides.

Future Improvements:
1) Launching to AppStore
2) Build a webversion
3) Use a better API that can grab advanced statistics and box scores as well
